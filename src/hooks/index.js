// src/hooks/index.js
// Central export hub for custom hooks. Each hook is defined in its own file for better separation of concerns.

// Utility hooks
export { useLenis } from "./useLenis";

// Store hooks (with selector pattern)
export { useTheme } from "./useTheme";
export { useLanguage } from "./useLanguage";
